# Stability of Steel Columns at Elevated Temperatures: A Finite Element Study

• Eigen value problem to determine the buckling load through FE formulation showed convergence with Euler’s formula

• Stresses were evaluated under thermo-mechanical loading for various boundary conditions of the column 

• Performed non-linear analysis of columns using Modified Riks approach in ABAQUS; determined critical thermomechanical stresses and facilitated the performance of post-buckling analysis until collapse
